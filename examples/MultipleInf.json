    "name": "SIRD model",
    "description": "A SIS Model with two infections and we use groups to track which infection hits people first.",
    "infectionTypes": "Two infections with different β and γ values. The first infection has a larger β and larger γ, so it is more infecitous per timestep, but the infection doesn't last as long.",
    "groups": "There are three groups. One for the Susceptible, one for people that were infected with Inf1 first and another one for people that got Inf2 as their first infection.",
    "betaMultipliers": "The beta multipliers are set to 1, so all groups can infect all groups equally.",
    "transitions": "Susceptible that get newly infected are moved to the group that maches the infection type and then remain in that group.",
    "initialCondition": "We start with 998 susceptible and 1 infected person for each infection type.",
    "globalBetaMultiplier": "No global beta multiplier is used.",
